# Programming Portfolio (C++)

A structured collection of **C++ projects** and **problem-solving exercises** designed to practice programming fundamentals, improve algorithmic thinking, and build a strong foundation in software development.


## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🔹 Projects:
Independent C++ projects demonstrating specific programming concepts:

- **Guess the Number Game** → Random number guessing with hints.  
- **Math Quiz Game** → Dynamic quiz with difficulty levels and operations.  
- **Rock Paper Scissors Game** → Classic game with score tracking and replay option.  

➡️ All projects are located inside:  
`projects/`


### 🔹 Problem Solving:
A large set of **100 problem-solving exercises** written in C++, divided into two levels:

- **Level 1 (50 problems)** → Focused on basics: input/output, conditions, loops, and simple functions.  
- **Level 2 (50 problems)** → Covers advanced logic: arrays, strings, algorithms, and structured programming.  

➡️ Exercises are located inside:  
`problem-solving-level-1/`  
`problem-solving-level-2/`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++  
- **Libraries**: `<iostream>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<cmath>` (depending on the project)  
- **Compiler**: g++
